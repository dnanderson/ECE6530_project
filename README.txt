Frequency Sythesis Lab 4.1-4.4 README
============

This is the README file for the Frequency Sythesis Lab Questions 4.1-4.4.
This will go over each file's purpose and operation.

-----------
bellenv.m

There is no user input required for this code.
This is a peice of MATLAB code that generates a decay function for use in
the bell.m function. This is done by using an exponential decay function.
This code is a helper file for other code. Examine it if further
insight is needed on how the envelope is generated.
-----------
bell.m

There is no user input required for this code.
This is a peice of MATLAB code that generates a bell function.
This is done by modulating a cosine function with another cosine function.
This code generates the full bell sound envelope.
While function does not create the sound itself, it can
however be called and used in other code to generate the sound.
Examine it if further insight is needed on how the bell sound is generated.
